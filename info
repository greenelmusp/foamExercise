//This is flow through a pipe
//U is adjusted to change the flow from laminar to turbulent
//pimpleFoam is used

Re=U*D/nu

D=5*10^-3
nu=10^-6
U=0.4                         //Re=2000

dx=5*10^-5
dt=5*10^-4
Co=U*dt/dx  


// It will diverge when the U is set to 1.6 m/s
// can use adjustable time step, MaxCo, but it won't help much since the model used (laminar flow) is not correct
